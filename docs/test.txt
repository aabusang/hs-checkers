I want to debug and fix the multi-capture logic. beware to keep code where they belong like, capture logic stays in rules.capture, and the like. simple beginner friendly code

I'll help you debug and fix the multi-capture logic while keeping the code organized. Let me first examine the relevant files to understand the current implementation.

Let me look for the capture-related code first:

Searched for files in
~/Code/games/checkers

Great, let me examine the capture rules:

Analyzed

Capture.hs:(1-101)
Let me also check the movement rules since they might interact with captures:

Analyzed

Movement.hs:(1-101)
Let me check the jumps module as well since it's referenced:

Searched for files in
~/Code/games/checkers
1 result
Analyzed

Jumps.hs:(1-101)
I notice a few issues with the current multi-capture logic:

There's some duplication between Rules.Capture and Rules.Jumps modules. Both have similar functionality but with different names.
The current implementation doesn't properly handle multi-captures - it only checks for single captures.
The code could be more beginner-friendly with better documentation and clearer function names.
Let me make the necessary changes to fix these issues. I'll:

Clean up the capture logic by consolidating it in Rules.Capture
Add proper multi-capture support
Improve documentation and naming
First, let's update the Capture module:

Now let's update the Jumps module to remove the duplicated functionality and reference the Capture module instead:

Finally, let's update the Movement module to properly handle multi-captures:

Here's a summary of the changes I've made to fix the multi-capture logic:

In Rules.Capture:
Added new getMultiCaptures function that finds all possible capture sequences
Added findCaptureSequence helper function to recursively build capture sequences
Improved piece-specific capture moves based on piece type (Man vs King)
Added better documentation
In Rules.Jumps:
Removed duplicate functionality
Now uses Rules.Capture functions for all capture-related logic
Simplified to just provide a convenience wrapper around getPossibleCaptures
In Rules.Movement:
Updated getValidMoves to handle multi-captures properly
When captures are available, they are mandatory
Returns the first move of each capture sequence when captures are available
Simplified getAllPossibleMoves implementation
The key improvements are:

Better organization: Capture logic is now centralized in Rules.Capture
Proper multi-capture support: The code now tracks full capture sequences
More beginner-friendly: Better documentation and simpler code structure
Mandatory captures: When captures are available, they must be taken
Piece-specific moves: Different rules for Man vs King pieces
The code should now correctly handle multi-captures while maintaining good organization and readability. Let me know if you'd like me to explain any part in more detail or if you'd like to test specific scenarios!

looks like we might as well just delete the jump module? we also have this bug: [17 of 26] Compiling Rules.Capture

/home/aabusang/Code/games/checkers/src/Rules/Capture.hs:18:51: error:
    Module ‘Board.Types’ does not export ‘getPieceAt’
   |

   |                                                   ^^^^^^^^^^

Yes, you're right! Let's fix these issues. First, let's fix the import error by checking where getPieceAt is actually defined:

Searched in
~/Code/games/checkers

I see that getPieceAt is actually defined in Board.Operations. Let's fix the imports in Capture.hs and then delete the Jumps module since we've moved all its functionality to Capture.hs.

First, let's fix the imports in Capture.hs:

Now let's check what modules are importing from Rules.Jumps so we can update them before deleting it:

We need to update Rules.Movement to use getPossibleCaptures from Rules.Capture instead of getAllValidJumpMoves from Rules.Jumps. Let's make that change:

Now we can safely delete the Rules.Jumps module since its functionality has been consolidated into Rules.Capture. Let me propose the command to delete it:

Ran terminal command
~/Code/games/checkers
$ rm /home/aabusang/Code/games/checkers/src/Rules/Jumps.hs

Great! Here's a summary of the changes I've made:

Fixed the import error in Rules.Capture.hs by importing getPieceAt from Board.Operations instead of Board.Types
Updated Rules.Movement.hs to use functions from Rules.Capture instead of Rules.Jumps
Deleted the redundant Rules.Jumps.hs module since all its functionality is now in Rules.Capture
The code should now be more organized with:

All capture-related logic centralized in Rules.Capture
No duplicate functionality between modules
Proper imports from the correct modules
Let me know if you'd like me to make any other improvements or if you have any questions!

Me

so we have man and kind in our getPossibleCaptures function, from where are we importing them from ? 

Looking at the imports in Rules.Capture.hs, we need to import PieceType(..) from Board.Types. Let me fix that:

Now we properly import PieceType(..) which includes both Man and King constructors. This should fix any undefined references to these types in the getPossibleCaptures function.

out multi capture isn't quite working yet. when try it, my piece isn't able to move again after the first capture, the other player has to move before I can. but that should not be the case. if where I land from a capture and can make another capture, I should be able to keep capturing until there is no more valid capture, then I stop and it's the other players turn. Also by the way, in this game, I want to have a rule where any piece (not just king) can capture backwards if the capture is available. MultiCapture can multicapture backwards as well

Ah, I see! We need to modify two things:

Allow backward captures for all pieces
Fix the multi-capture logic to allow continuous captures in the same turn
Let's first update the capture logic in Rules.Capture.hs:

Now let's check Game.State to ensure it properly handles multi-captures:

State.hs:(1-151)
I see the issue. The problem is in createNewGameState - it always switches the player after a move, even if there are more captures available. Let's modify it to handle multi-captures:

The changes I've made:

In Rules.Capture.hs:
Modified getPossibleCaptures to allow all pieces (both Man and King) to capture in any direction
Simplified the capture logic since direction restrictions are removed
In Game.State.hs:
Updated createNewGameState to handle multi-captures by:
Checking if more captures are available after a capture move
Keeping the same player's turn if more captures are available
Keeping the piece selected if it can make more captures
Only showing valid capture moves from the current piece's new position
Now the game should:

Allow any piece to capture backwards
Support proper multi-captures where a piece can keep capturing until no more captures are available
Force the player to continue capturing with the same piece if more captures are available
Only switch to the other player's turn when no more captures are possible
Let me know if you'd like me to explain any part in more detail or if you'd like to test specific scenarios!

so I am noticing that in a multi-capture, I can still select the piece that just finished one capture but it doesn't let me continue with it to make the next capture which is available in the same turn, do you want to look at our logic again? and making sure we are connecting well to the UI? 

Let's check how the UI connects to our game logic and trace through the multi-capture flow. First, let me look at the UI code:

Searched for files in
~/Code/games/checkers
11 results
Let me check the input handling and game controller:

Analyzed

Input.hs:(1-101)
I see the issue. In UI.Input, when we make a move, we're always clearing the selection (selectedPosition = Nothing) even for multi-captures. We need to update this to handle multi-captures properly.

Also, let me check our makeMove function in Game.State again to ensure we're passing the right information:

Analyzed

State.hs:(91-131)
Let's fix both the UI and game state handling:

The changes I've made:

In UI.Input:

Added proper imports for the capture-related functions
In Game.State:
Updated makeMove to enforce using the same piece for multi-captures
Updated selectPiece to only allow selecting the piece that just captured during a multi-capture sequence
Added validation to ensure the player continues with the same piece during multi-captures
The multi-capture logic now:
Forces the player to continue with the same piece during a multi-capture sequence
Keeps the piece selected after a capture if more captures are available
Only allows selecting the piece that just captured when in a multi-capture sequence
Properly shows valid capture moves after each capture in the sequence
This should fix the issues with multi-capture and make it work as expected:

Any piece can capture backwards
Multi-captures are enforced - must continue capturing with the same piece if possible
The UI properly keeps the piece selected during multi-captures
The game state properly tracks and enforces multi-capture rules

Fixed imports to get functions from the right modules
In UI.Input:
Simplified multi-capture handling by relying on Game.State's logic
Fixed imports to only include what we need
Added toUIPosition for converting positions
The multi-capture logic is now simpler:

Game.State handles all the multi-capture rules and state
UI just needs to reflect the game state's selected position
No duplicate logic between UI and game state

Looking at the output, I can see a pattern of repeated moves between the same positions, which suggests our multi-capture logic isn't working correctly. The pieces seem to be moving back and forth between positions (5,3) and (3,1), and between (4,2) and other positions.

Let's check our capture validation in Rules.Capture.hs:

Edited
Capture.hs
+22

Open diff
The key changes I've made:

Added a check in isValidCapture to ensure there's actually a piece to capture (not just that it's an opponent's piece)
Most importantly, fixed the multi-capture logic in findCaptureSequence:
Now we actually remove captured pieces when checking for next possible captures
Added removeCapturedPiece helper function to simulate the board state after captures
Use boardAfterCaptures when looking for next captures
The main issue was that we weren't removing captured pieces when looking for next captures in a sequence. This meant that:

A piece could capture the same opponent piece multiple times
The same positions could be visited multiple times
Now the logic should work correctly:

Each piece can only be captured once
When checking for next captures, we use a board state that reflects previous captures
The validation ensures there's actually a piece to capture
This should prevent the back-and-forth captures we were seeing in the output. Let me know if you'd like me to explain any part in more detail!

on it's not back and forth capture and repeated attempts I made to capture a piece backward I just could not. that would have been second capture in a multi-capture move I was trying, now does the output make sense to you? Welcome to Checkers!

Ah, now I understand! The issue is that we're not properly handling backward captures in our getPossibleCaptures function. Even though we list all four directions (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right), we're not properly handling the direction validation.

Let me check Rules.Movement.hs to see how it interacts with captures:

Analyzed

Movement.hs:(1-51)
I see the issue now. The isValidDirection function in Rules.Movement is still enforcing directional rules even for captures. We need to modify this to allow backward captures.

Let's update Rules.Movement:

Edited
Movement.hs
+7

Open diff
Now the logic should work correctly:

Kings can move in any direction (no change)
Regular pieces (Man) can:
Move forward only for normal moves (White up, Black down)
Move in any direction for capture moves
Continue capturing in any direction during a multi-capture sequence
This should fix the issue where you couldn't make backward captures during a multi-capture sequence. The key change is that we now explicitly check if it's a capture move before applying directional restrictions.

Let me know if you'd like to test it out or if you need any clarification!

beautiful, now I need a basic AI player to play against because so far I have been the one moving both my pieces (black, from bottom to top) and also moving the imaginery opponents pieces

I'll help you create a basic AI player. Let's create a new module called AI.Basic that will implement a simple strategy: prioritize captures, then prefer moves that advance pieces towards the opponent's side.

First, let's create the AI module:

There is an AI folder, let's work in there, there is a also a AIPlayer module or do you have a new idea of how we should structure out AI modules?
